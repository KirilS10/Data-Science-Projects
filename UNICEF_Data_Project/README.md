📌Task:

📍UNICEF is an international UN organisation whose mission is to improve the well-being of children around the world.
The goal of the project is to track the impact of the living conditions of students aged 15 to 22 years on their math performance in order to identify students at risk at an early stage.

📍The project can be done with the help of a model that would predict the results of the state exam in mathematics for each student of the school (here it is, the power of ML!). To determine the parameters of the future model, conduct an intelligence analysis of the data and make a report on its results.
